		  <h2>:Mission Statement:</h2>
		  <p>At the Turkey Independence Movement (TIM), we stand united in our mission to liberate turkeys from the cycle of slaughter and exploitation. We believe in a world where turkeys are recognized as sentient beings, deserving of respect, compassion, and the right to live free from harm. Through education, advocacy, and action, we strive to raise awareness about the plight of turkeys in industrial farming and holiday traditions. Our movement seeks to promote ethical alternatives, support sanctuaries, and inspire a shift toward cruelty-free living. Together, we march toward a future where turkeys are no longer seen as mere commodities, but as individuals with their own place in the worldâ€”free to roam, gobble, and thrive. Join us in the fight for turkey independence! âœŠðŸ¦ƒ</p>
